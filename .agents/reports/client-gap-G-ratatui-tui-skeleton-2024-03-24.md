# Gap G — Ratatui TUI Skeleton Implementation Report
Date: 2024-03-24
Status: COMPLETE

## What was implemented

- `crates/avix-cli/Cargo.toml` — added ratatui 0.26 and crossterm 0.27 dependencies
- `crates/avix-cli/src/tui/mod.rs` — module declaration for TUI submodules
- `crates/avix-cli/src/tui/state.rs` — TUI state management with reducer pattern and tests
- `crates/avix-cli/src/tui/app.rs` — basic TUI application with terminal setup, main loop, key handlers, and UI rendering
- `crates/avix-cli/src/main.rs` — added --tui flag to CLI parser and launch logic for TUI mode
- Basic app state: connected bool, agents list, notifications count, hil pending count
- Key handlers: q=quit, c=connect (connects to ATP server), a=agent spawn (stub)
- Integration with avix-client-core: ATP connection, agent list fetching, notification counting, HIL pending counting
- UI layout: status bar (connected/disconnected), agents list, notification bar (counts)
- HIL modal stub (counts shown in notification bar, no separate modal yet)

## Clippy

PASS (zero warnings with -D warnings)

## Remaining gaps / ignored tests

- `atp::dispatcher::tests::*` — 5 tests ignored: requires mock WS transport (Gap B)
- `atp::event_emitter::tests::*` — 2 tests ignored: requires mock Dispatcher transport (Gap B)

## Bugs found during implementation

None.

## Notes for the next agent

This implements the basic TUI skeleton as specified. Event subscription (EventEmitter integration) and full HIL modal UI are stubbed or not implemented yet — they can be added in Gap H. The TUI can be launched with `avix --tui` and connects to the ATP server on 'c' keypress, fetching and displaying agents. Notifications and HIL counts are updated from the shared state.
